CSS KNowledge
padding: 10px 20px; //top-bottom left-right
display: flex; // to bring the contents from vertical to hhorizontal
align-items: center; //To centre the items after placing them hor using flex
justify-content: space-between; //To provide the equispacing between the hor. contents
justify-content: flex-end; //To bring all the contents to right
cursor: pointer; //To act the cursor over there as a pointer/hand
margin and padding : Padding represents the amount of inner space an element has, while the margin is space available surrounding an element.
width: 50px; height: 50px; border-radius: 50%;  //TO create the circle
top: 0; bottom: 0; margin: auto;  //To bring the content to center
If child is position : absolute, parent needs to be position : relative
For slider, onclick feature, pass it as prop, then use thaat prop. When passing the parameter in Onclick, them there is the need of the arrow function
tansform:translateX(-100vw) //It shifts to next slide used in the flex
z-index : Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. Note: Z index only works on positioned elements ( position:absolute , position:relative , or position:fixed ).
transition: all 1s ease; //To add the transitions to the slider
flex-wrap: wrap; //To wrap the extra items to the next line
width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; //To bring the item to the middle of the containber
vh : The full form of VH is viewport height. It works like the percentage unit as well. Specifying 10vh is equivalent to occupying 10% of entire visible screen height
object-fit: cover; //To crop the image, and to fit it in the given width height
background-size: cover //Resize the background image to cover the entire container, even if it has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges
min-width :If the content is smaller than the minimum width, the minimum width will be applied. If the content is larger than the minimum width, the min-width property has no effect.

To make the website responsive, make one file for that and in the styled components, styled them separately
